	<p>Hello everyone! I wanted to provide some of the resources that we use within our classroom. These are all great resources that could be used to encourage your child's reading. Make sure to check them out! Also, I have linked the Storytime Anytime YouTube channel for great read aloud options. Just a reminder that students need ten (10) AR points for each nine weeks. If they meet this goal, they can attend the AR party. They need a total of 40 AR points to attend the AR field trip at the end of the year. As always, if you have any questions just reach out. You can find my contact information linked under "Contact Me!"</p>
